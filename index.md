## Conditionals

Main goal by writing code is to SOLVE a PROBLEM.

### If...else statements

`var musicians = -1;

if( musicians <= 0) {
    console.log("not a group");
} else if ( musicians === 1 ){
    console.log("solo");
} else if ( musicians === 2 ){
    console.log("duet");
} else if ( musicians === 3 ){
    console.log("trio");
} else if ( musicians === 4 ){
    console.log("quartet");
} else {
    console.log("this is a large group");
}`

### Logical Operators

`var colt = "not busy";
var weather = "nice";

if (colt === "not busy" && weather === "nice") {
  console.log("go to the park");
}`
